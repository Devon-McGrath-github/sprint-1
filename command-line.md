The command line is an interface you can use to type commands directly to a computers operating system. These 'commands' are simply lines of text, however they require very specific keywords and must be typed in a specific syntax to have an affect. 

The command line interface is not a Graphical User Interface (GUI), instead of having graphical and visual indicators which are a more common and more intuitive interface, you interact with the command line purely through text.

However, despite these shortcomings the command line interface does have some advantages, such as potentially being significantly faster to use, and offering more control over your operating system.
